# NEAR AI: Building a Truly Open AI

Welcome! [NEAR AI](https://near.ai) is a toolkit to help build, measure, and deploy AI systems focused on [agents](./agents/quickstart.md).

Driven by one of the minds behinds **TensorFlow** and the **Transformer Architecture**, NEAR AI puts you back in control. Your data stays yours, and your AI works for you, with no compromises on privacy or ownership.
